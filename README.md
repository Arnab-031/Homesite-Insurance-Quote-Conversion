# Homesite-Insurance-Quote-Conversion
This project addresses the Homesite Insurance Quote Conversion prediction problem, where the goal is to predict the probability that a customer will buy a quoted insurance plan. The approach uses various classification models, applies SMOTE for class balancing, and builds an ensemble stacking model with hyperparameter tuning.
